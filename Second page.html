Imbolc is most likely better known as St. Brigid's day. Though Christian's produced a story about St. Brigid
to convert Scots and Irish alike to Christianity, "St. Brigid's Day" Imbolc is still mainly celebrated by 
neo-pagans and wiccans. This celebration is still a celebration of rebirth and light.  </p>
