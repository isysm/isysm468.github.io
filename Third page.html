<p><font face="georgia" color="#151b8d"> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This holiday was origionally the marker for the halfway point between 
Winter and Spring. The day is supposed to represent a rebirth from the death 
of Winter. This holiday was also a mean to celebrate the Goddess of rebirth, Brigid.
Legends say that Brigid was born with a flame in her head and to acknowledge this, 
flaming effigies were built in her honor. </font></p>
